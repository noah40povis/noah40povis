### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


:dragon_face: Hi everyone! I am a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer who is currently wrapping up their time at @LambdaSchool. 
I am now searching the :earth_americas: (more specifically NY,NY) for exciting job opportunities that will specifically allow me to work with brilliant individuals at a daring tech company. 

:back: Before signing up for Lambda to pursue a career in engineering I was a salesmen for a healthcare startup. I have great communication skills and a high emotional IQ that allows me to thrive in most social and team settings. I hope to combine my personal skills with my new found technical skills to become a dynamic force on any team I join! 

:calling: Please reach out if you want to discuss ideas, code, startups or you are interested in working with me.
